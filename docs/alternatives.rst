Alternatives
====================================

There are several excellent 3d plotting tools for networkx graphs.
These alternative approaches will be sufficient if you want to plot graphs in 3D, animate them, get out-of-the-box
interactivity, and generally use more mature software.


Using matplotlib

On the other hand, if you want an extensible framework for using your networkx graph as an interface to a powerful 3D
game engine, nx3d may be right for you. See the :doc:`install` page to get started.

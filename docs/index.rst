   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to nx3d's documentation!
================================

``nx3d`` provides 3D plotting functionality for the ``networkx`` Python package.

The `project homepage <https://github.com/ekalosak/nx3d>`_ has quickstart instructions.

Hello world, a beginner's tutorial
------------------------------------
To get started with ``nx3d``, check out the :doc:`examples` page. Following along with the source code for the diffusion example
is a good introductory tutorial.

What it is
------------------------------------
* ``nx3d`` is a Python3 package used to produce interactive 3D visualizations of graphs `without` having to think about
  the 3D rendering process, 3D models, the graphics engine, or anything `but` your graph.

What it isn't
------------------------------------

* ``nx3d`` is not a commandline utility. While it supports some basic things like demos via ``python -m nx3d``, the CLI
  is not supported beyond that.

Code of Conduct
------------------------------------
Any x-phobia-like behavior will not fly.

More formally, I'll enforce the
`Contributor Covenant <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/>`_. Feel free to contact me
(helloateric att gmaaail dottt comj) with issues. It's better to get this settled before any issues arise, so please
excuse the cart-before-horse nature of setting a code of conduct this early into the project's lifecycle.

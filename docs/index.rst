   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to nx3d's documentation!
================================

The `project homepage <https://github.com/ekalosak/nx3d>`_ has quickstart instructions.

Alternatives
------------------------------------
Check out the lighter-weight alternatives first on the :doc:`alternatives` page.

Hello world, a beginner's tutorial
------------------------------------
To get started with ``nx3d``, check out the :doc:`examples` page. Following along with the source code for the diffusion example
is a good introductory tutorial.

What it is
------------------------------------
* ``nx3d`` is a Python3 package used to produce interactive 3D visualizations of graphs `without` having to think about
  the 3D rendering process, 3D models, the graphics engine, or anything `but` your graph.

What it isn't
------------------------------------

* ``nx3d`` is not a commandline utility. While it supports some basic things like demos via ``python -m nx3d``, the CLI
  is not supported beyond that.

Code of Conduct

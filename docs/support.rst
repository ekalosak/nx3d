Issue tracking
===============

Bugs
--------------
If you run into a bug when using `nx3d`, please follow these steps:

1. Check the `issue tracker <https://github.com/ekalosak/nx3d/issues>`_ to see if someone else has also run into your
bug. It will be useful to filter by the bug tag ("label:bug").
2. If someone else hasn't reported it yet, submit your bug report - click the green "New issue" button on the issue
tracker.

Features
--------------
If there's some functionality you'd like to see in `nx3d` that just isn't there yet, I'd love to hear from you. Please
submit your feature request to the issue tracker.

- NX-6 P4 save video / snapshot to file
- NX-8 P4 mouse click and drag on node pulls with stickyness on original location along node to free area and finally to
  gravity around destination node.
  - blocked by NX-3
  - tags: example
- NX-4 P4 tests
  - for the trig: add collision nodes to the ends of the edges and check that they collide with source and sink nodes
  - for the API: fizzbuzz it, check some basic content of the NxPlot once instantiated
  - CI running the tests and a badge
- NX-3 P5 mouse click and pull expands graph; probably requires generating the panda3d body for the graph
- NX-9 P5 press r to reset camera position
- NX-12 P5 press t to toggle default spin
- NX-13 P5 press h to toggle GUI
- NX-15 P5 press m to toggle mouse control
- NX-14 P5 better formatting of floats and printed objects in GUI
- NX-18 P5 Example clients
  - NX-7 P5 physics like goop so when moved
  - NX-10 P5 enable 'peek' with camera by shifting lense with keyboard controls k, l
  - NX-16 P5 rotation with momentum and acceleration
- NX-19 P5 fix frame increment and time increment inputs to `state_trans_func`
  - di is always 0
- NX-23 P5 press esc to quit
- NX-21 P5 camera controls not theta and phi but dx and dy relative to the tangent plane of the sphere
- NX-20 P5 default spin for graph diffusion example

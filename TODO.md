IN PROGRESS:
- NX-0-DiGraph

TODO:
- NX-0 P0 support for DiGraph and MultiDiGraph
  - DiGraph model, interface
  - MultiGraph model, interface
  - MultiDiGraph model, interface

- NX-22 P3 implement state transition functionality for edge color and labels (currently only for nodes via NX-11)
- NX-21 P3 camera controls not theta and phi but dx and dy relative to the tangent plane of the sphere
- NX-20 P3 default spin for graph diffusion example

# Contribute
Thank you for considering contributing to `nx3d`.

Currently, there's no enforced testing, formatting, linting, or typechecking with CI. Let's say that's intentional to
keep this young project lightweight.  With that in mind, the pre-commit hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` apply
linting and formatting to keep the project clean. Please use the pre-commit hooks before opening a PR.

## Clone the code

## Setup the development environment

You can do this as you like, though you might consider:
1. Install `poetry`
2. Run `poetry shell`
3. Run `poetry install`
4. Verify the installation by running `python -m nx3d`

## Set up pre-commit
From this project's root, initialize pre-commit as follows:

```sh
pre-commit install
pre-commit run -a
```

## Update the docs
1. Update the inline docstrings and/or the files in the docs/ directory.
2. Navigate to the docs/ dir and run `make html` to preview your changes.
3. When you cut a PR, the CI will trigger a ReadTheDocs build.
4. When merged, the CD will publish those docs (3).

### First time updating the docs
I used `brew install python-sphinx`, see installation instructions on [www.sphinx-doc.org](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html).

## Hack on some code
See TODO.md for open tasks.

## Open a PR

When it merges, CD will push to PyPi and ReadTheDocs.
